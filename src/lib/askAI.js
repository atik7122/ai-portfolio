        `,
        projects: `
            Zubair has worked on a wide range of applied AI, research, and industry-scale projects.

            Applied AI Projects include a Paralegal Agent and Visa Petition Agent, which is an agentic AI system using retrieval-augmented generation and multi-agent orchestration. This full-stack system generates visa petitions, letters of recommendation, and legal drafts with evaluation and version control. It was built using Next.js, React, Supabase, PostgreSQL, vector search, and workflow automation tools like n8n.

            Another applied project is a Movement-Monitoring Wearable for healthcare. This is an edge-AI system that performs on-device inference to detect unusual patient movement and trigger real-time caregiver alerts. It runs on a Raspberry Pi Zero W using IMU sensor data, Python, and embedded machine learning.

            Research and academic projects include a transformer-based sentiment analysis system for software engineering data. By using vocabulary augmentation and transformer ensembling, the system achieved 1 to 26 percent F1-score improvement and was published at ICSOFT 2023.

            He also worked on complex nurse care activity recognition using smartphone sensor data. The system uses denoising filters, overlapping windows, and Random Forest models to handle noisy labels in healthcare activity recognition.

            Another computer vision project focuses on Bangla license plate detection. Synthetic data generated from GTA V was used to improve YOLO-based detection performance in real-world scenarios where labeled data is scarce.

            Professional technical projects include an ARPU Enhancer Model based on contextual multi-armed bandits for offer recommendation, a Network Coverage Monitor using KD and Ball-tree indexing that reduced processing time from two weeks to two hours, and a New-Site Recommender using set-cover optimization that delivered a 58 percent business potential gain.

            He also built a Trade Visibility System that performs object detection across more than 700 thousand retail outlets with about 75 percent recall in production. Additional projects include large-scale customer segmentation for over 50 million users and an intervention time prediction model that achieved a 67 percent conversion rate.
